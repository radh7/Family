            It’s incredible to think how just a few days ago before our trip, I didn’t even know
            you were gonna become this important in my life. Meeting you again in <b>Ayodhya</b> was a chance I’m
            forever grateful for. In the beginning, I wasn’t sure how we would
            connect, how we’d talk, or how you’d be. But now, after just a short
            time of talking, I’ve come to realize something—you're absolutely
            amazing

          <p>
           There’s this strength, a presence that’s hard to describe. 
            From the confidence in your eyes to the warmth in your embrace, 
            everything about you feels just right.
            Honestly, sometimes it seems like you were made to stand out, 
            a masterpiece designed to make the world better.

        </div>
        <div class="back">
          <p>
            Beyond the surface, what truly stands out is your dedication, hard
            work, and passion. You're not just someone to admire for your looks,
            but an inspiration. Seeing how driven and focused you are in
            everything you do makes me respect you even more. I believe you
            embody the qualities of a true leader—someone who commands respect
            in every way.

            other for a short time, you won't forget me. No matter what, I wish
